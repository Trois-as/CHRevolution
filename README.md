# Cock Hero Revolution
Use your smartphone as a controller for Cock Hero Revolution games

The project :
Cock Hero Revolution (stuck-up name, but I had no other idea) is a controller for Cock Hero videos. When I discover 
these videos with their cool compilation, good selection of music, specials effects like rythm'n games, etc, they were 
just lacking some interactivity...

Later I have found an android application called Accelerometer Mouse which allow to use your androphone as a mouse if you 
install Accelerometer Mouse Server on your PC but also read all the informations send by the accelerometer of your phone. 
Luckily the creator of these apps publish there sources, so I tried to custom the server app to use a phone like a 
Vstroker to interact with  Cock Hero videos (win point when you are in the rhythm, alert when you are too slow or to fast, 
etc).

This first version is really basic, I release it to have opinion about the concept, don't hesitate to tell me what you 
think: if it's that just a crap without potential, that steal you 1 hour of your life or what  do you wish to have in a 
Cock Hero controller.

I have also open a blog about Cock Hero Revolution :
